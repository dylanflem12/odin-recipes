            <li>2 tbsp white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cooking salt/kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 litre/quart canola/vegetable oil</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cut:</strong> Peel the potatoes. Cut into 6mm / 1/4" French fries using a serrated knife.</li>
                <li>Keep cut fries submerged in a bowl of water bowl to prevent them from going brown while you cut the remainder. (No need for actual soaking beyond this).</li>
                <li><strong>Rinse:</strong> Transfer potatoes to a colander and rinse under tap water for 15-20 seconds.</li>
                <li><strong>Simmer:</strong> Place fries in a large pot with 2 litres/quarts of cold tap water, vinegar and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat then immediately reduce stove to low so the surface is rippling gently, not big bubbles. Cook for 10 minutes then careful remove using a slotted spoon into a colander (do not tip the colander, fries will break).</li>
                <li><strong>Dry 5 min:</strong> Spread the fries on 2 tea towel lined trays. Leave them to steam dry for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Separate the fries into 3 batches (for cooking).</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Fry #1:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Heat oil</strong> to 205C/400F over medium heat.</li>
                <li><strong>10 sec pause:</strong> Lower 1/3 of Batch 1 fries into the oil using a slotted spoon. WAIT 10 seconds, add another 1/3 of the fires, wait 10 seconds, then add the remaining batch 1 of fries.</li>
                <li><strong>50 sec fry:</strong> Fry for 50 seconds, moving them around once or twice. Then remove with a slotted spoon onto 2 paper towel lined trays, spread out in a single layer. The fries will still be white and floppy.</li>
                <li><strong>Repeat</strong> steps 1-3 with batches 2 and 3, ensuring the oil is back at 205C/400F before cooking.</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Fry #2:</h3>
            <ol>

                <li><strong>Line a large bowl:</strong> with paper towels - for draining and tossing</li>
                <li><strong>Fry #2:</strong> Heat oil to 205C/400F. Fry half the French fries for 4 minutes, moving them around twice, or until golden brown and crispy. Drain in the lined bowl, then repeat with remaining fries.</li>
